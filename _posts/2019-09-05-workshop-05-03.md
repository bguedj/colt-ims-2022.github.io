    Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are systems capable of
    presenting feedback to a user based only on the modulation of their brain
    signals. I will present results of immediate brain plasticity after one
    hour of BCI performance from a completely inexperienced user with two
    different BCI systems, one based on event-related potentials and the other
    one based on the modulation of sensorimotor rhythms. Our analyses show
    changes in gray-matter of specific brain regions following a single session
    of BCI usage. More importantly, both BCI approaches resulted in plastic
    changes within the respective brain regions that were the most activated
    according to the BCI task: sensorimotor region after the motor imagery
    based BCI session and occipital/parietal areas following the event-related
    potential BCI use.
    I will also present a new method to maximize the coherence of neural
    signals from different sources, that can be used to, for example, better
    estimate corticomuscular coherence and show results comparing this novel
    method with other mass-bivariate
    approaches. All this research has been performed collaboratively between
    the Department of Neurology at MPI for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences,
    Leipzig, the Machine Learning Group of the TU-Berlin and the Dept. of
    Informatics, Statistics and Mathematics from the Public University of
    Navarre.

  title: "A Platform for Large-scale Neuroscientific Studies"
  abstract: |
    Neurophysiological research is expensive and complicated. The
    resulting necessity to conduct studies in a laboratory limits ecological
    validity, scalability, and generalisability of findings. We introduce MYND:
    a platform for at-home participation in large-scale neuroscientific
    studies. Our goal is to establish user-experience design as a paradigm in
    neuroscientific research to overcome the limits of current studies and to
    improve ecological validity. MYND provides a smartphone application with
    a simple user interface that guides subjects through experiment selection,
    hardware fitting, recording, and upload. This interface enables subjects to
    self-administer multi-day studies that include both neurophysiological
    recording sessions and questionnaires. Thirty-two subjects recorded a total
    of 5846 neurophysiological trials over seven days at home. Results
    indicate that the application can be used for studies outside of a
    laboratory, without the need for external guidance. MYND shows that
    the intersection between neuroscience and human-computer interaction could
    help to break with the limitations of neuroscientific research by enabling
    neurophysiological recordings with large populations in a realistic context.

  title: "Machine learning for Multiscale Diagnostic Bioelectronics: From nerve signals to millions of vital signs"
  abstract: |
    With the advent of better peripheral neural interfaces,
    non-invasive physiological sensors and rapid digitization of large amounts
    of healthcare data, new opportunities arise for creating machine learning
    algorithms that will generate a more holistic view of patient health. These
    algorithms will power the next generation bioelectronic medicine devices to
    enable early diagnosis, disease severity assessment and personalization and
    adaptability of a therapy. We will present work from the Neural and Data
    Science lab that combines machine learning with neural and physiological
    signal processing, using data from multiple sources and scales. Using vagus
    nerve recordings, we focus on how the peripheral nervous system senses the
    state and affects the function of the immune and metabolic systems. We want
    to use this knowledge to develop devices that are able to diagnose and
    treat various diseases and conditions before symptoms appear. For the same
    reasons, we are also using multimodal noninvasive physiological signals to
    infer autonomic nervous system function and imbalance. Finally, we are
    leveraging the access to large amounts of healthcare data through the
    Northwell health system, building machine learning algorithms that can
    predict patient decompensation, using millions of vital signs.

  title: "Can we help the brain rewire itself? Hints from the functions and mechanisms acting during sleep"
  abstract: |
    Direct or indirect stimulation of brain activity through brain
    machine interfaces holds the promise of triggering the enduring network
    modifications necessary to functional recovery. Possibly daunting at first,
    this aim appears more reachable with regard to the dramatic plastic changes
    occurring in healthy brains on a daily basis. In light of recent results, I
    will discuss the putative mechanisms exploited by the mammalian brain to
    control plasticity during sleep. I will then elaborate on how such
    mechanisms, originally promoting long-term memory and homeostasis, can be
    possibly leveraged for recovery.

  title: "Connecting brains and machines for neurorehabilitation: from in vivo studies to human applications"
  abstract: |
    Neuroprostheses are devices that interface with the nervous
    system and supplement or substitute functionality in the patient's body. In
    the collective imagination, neuroprotheses are primarily used to restore
    sensory (e.g. acoustic or visual neuroprostheses) or motor capabilities
    (e.g. artificial limbs), but in the recent years, new devices to be applied
    directly at the brain level are taking place. The idea is to use them to
    treat the neuronal injury in the brain, where the damage is actually
    located, and to promote brain plasticity in order to speed up the recovery
    process. Their implementation requires the knowledge of how the neural
    dynamics is affected by the lesion and whether and how electrical
    stimulation can reshape or restore the original behavior, both on a short
    and a long term perspective. To respond to these and related questions,
    more than 10 years ago researchers have explored the possibility to create
    ‘neurohybrid’ systems at the interface between neuroscience and robotics,
    thus providing an excellent test bed for modulation of neuronal tissue and
    forming the basis of future bi-directional Brain Machine Interfaces and
    Prostheses. Within this framework, I will present recent results related to
    closed-loop paradigms for brain repair in vivo, focusing on how different
    types of stimulation (open vs closed-loop activity-dependent stimulation)
    can affect the neural activity.
    Further, I will describe our current work on human rehabilitation: we make
    use of neuromodulation of brain cortex in adjunction to the traditional
    motor or cognitive treatment, and we observe the neural correlates of
    rehabilitation intervention through high-density electroencephalography
    (hdEEG). Finally, we will briefly present exoskeletons and prostheses
    developed in our department for humans, and will address how, in the
    future, the introduction of neural signals into the control policy of such
    devices might affect rehabilitation.

  title: "Neural Interfaces Clinical applications: focus on stroke rehabilitation"
  abstract: |
    Rehabilitation studies leveraging brain-machine interface (BMI)
    technology have demonstrated clinical improvements with systems linking
    decoded brain activity with peripheral feedback through the movement of an
    orthosis. In these systems, the decoded movement intention from brain
    signals is translated into movement of the peripheral orthosis, giving
    patients feedback about their brain activity. This allows them first to
    control their neural activity patterns and adjust them to a given movement
    and second leverages the endogenous sensorimotor learning system to link
    these brain signals and the activation of the peripheral nervous system. So
    far, studies have been limited to linking patterns from non-invasively
    acquired brain signals to single movements such as only grasping or only
    reaching, because of the low number of movements that can be reliably
    decoded on a single-trial basis using non-invasive means. Thus, one way to
    improve upon current state-of-the-art is to use a neural recording modality
    that allows for accurate, single-trial decoding of a greater number of
    movements, and deliver feedback of these decoded movement intention signals
    through an orthosis with multiple degrees of freedom, allowing functional
    movements. I will present a novel brain-machine interface rehabilitation
    system for hemiplegic chronic stroke patients that leverages a temporarily
    implanted intracortical multi-electrode array, surface EMG and a seven
    degree-of-freedom arm and hand orthosis. Furthermore, I will present the
    usability of the system, behavioral and clinical results in a severely
    paralyzed chronic stroke patient implanted for more than 17 months.

  title: "Sensory Neuroprosthetics: Methods to assess functional reorganization and predict the outcome"
  abstract: |
    Sensory Substitution Devices (SSD) aim to restore a lost
    sensory modality using another that remains intact; this is possible due to
    neuroplasticity, the brain’s ability to adapt to a changing environment.
    Different SSD have been developed for visual, auditory, vestibular and
    peripheral sensation restoration but the brain changes behind are still
    unknown. Neuroimage data analysis offers a great opportunity to better
    understand these brain changes and be able to develop more personalized
    rehabilitation strategies. While most of the studies in the literature
    focus on comparing the brain’s activation pattern during pre- and
    post-treatment task, functional connectomics are better suited to study how
    the networks of the brain have been reorganized and to identify the
    networks that need to be stimulated in order to obtain a better outcome. I
    will present the results obtained after 6 months of visual rehabilitation
    of blind children using a SSD that transform visual information to tactile
    stimuli using a small hand-sized elastomeric device. I will focus on the
    different methods used to evaluate the brain functional reorganization with
    neuroimage data to study functional differences in blind people compared to
    sighted individuals, analyze connectivity changes after training, and
    perform individualized prediction of rehabilitation outcome. This research
    has been performed collaboratively between Massachusetts General Hospital -
    Harvard Medical School, Complutense University of Madrid and Tecnalia.

  title: "Real-time, bidirectional interfacing with the nervous system: lessons from biology and engineering"
  abstract: |
    Bidirectional neural-computer interfaces record and decode
    neural activity, and modulate it in real-time by delivering
    neurostimulation back into the central or the peripheral nervous system, in
    a responsive and adaptive manner.  Applications of such interfaces range
    from neuroplasticity, neurorehabilitation and delivery of sensory feedback
    to the cortex, to modulation of circuits involved in abnormal motor
    movement, chronic pain, etc.  Such interfaces rely
    on semi-real-time operation of a closed-loop system and on reliable chronic
    interfacing with neural tissue, two principles that pose special challenges
    on both biological and engineering fronts.  This presentation will discuss
    some of these challenges and ways to address them, in the context of
    systems that interface with the brain and with the peripheral nervous
    system.
