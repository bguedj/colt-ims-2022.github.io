  abstract: |
    Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are systems capable of
    presenting feedback to a user based only on the modulation of their brain
    signals. I will present results of immediate brain plasticity after one
    hour of BCI performance from a completely inexperienced user with two
    different BCI systems, one based on event-related potentials and the other
    one based on the modulation of sensorimotor rhythms. Our analyses show
    changes in gray-matter of specific brain regions following a single session
    of BCI usage. More importantly, both BCI approaches resulted in plastic
    changes within the respective brain regions that were the most activated
    according to the BCI task: sensorimotor region after the motor imagery
    based BCI session and occipital/parietal areas following the event-related
    potential BCI use.
    I will also present a new method to maximize the coherence of neural
    signals from different sources, that can be used to, for example, better
    estimate corticomuscular coherence and show results comparing this novel
    method with other mass-bivariate
    approaches. All this research has been performed collaboratively between
    the Department of Neurology at MPI for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences,
    Leipzig, the Machine Learning Group of the TU-Berlin and the Dept. of
    Informatics, Statistics and Mathematics from the Public University of
    Navarre.
