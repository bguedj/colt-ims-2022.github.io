  abstract: |
    In this short talk I would like to address and discuss two different
    research themes: (1) Of dynamics and landscapes in Machine Learning:
    understanding the interplay between the geometry of the risk, loss,
    energy landscape and the dynamics within it is a central question in
    several problems of high-dimensional statistics as well as for deep
    neural networks. I will outline questions, directions and some ongoing
    works on these topics. (2) Machine Learning and Quantum Many Body
    Physics. Deep Neural Networks are a promising tool to study strongly
    interacting quantum particle systems. A main challenge that I would like
    to address consists in understanding the “complexity” of physical
    many-body wave-functions and the expressivity power of DNNs to represent
    them, and how all that is related to the nature of quantum phases, e.g.
    to many-body localisation, integrability, ground state vs high-energy
    state, etc.

    Training a neural network on a classification task typically amounts at
    optimizing a highly non-convex objective function. The analysis of simple
    (but phenomenologically rich) models show that efficient learning is made
    possible by the existence of rare but very dense regions of optimal
    configurations, which have appealing robustness and generalization
    properties. Learning algorithms can be explicitly designed to target such
    regions. In a recent work we have showed that Quantum Annealing is also
    attracted to these states and therefore can be used as an efficient tool
    for training neural networks (leading to an exponential speed-up compared
    with classical Simulated Annealing). More generally, our theory on how to
    efficiently target these regions could provide efficient algorithmic
    solutions to non-standard architectures based on custom hardware.

  title: "High-dimensional random landscapes: critical points statistics and geometrical transitions"
  author:

    family: Ros
    institute: "Paris Saclay"
  abstract:
    Understanding the statistical properties of complex, high-dimensional
    functionals (or landscapes) is a central problem in many contexts,
    including computer science and machine learning. In this short talk I will
    focus on the statistical distribution of the stationary points of random
    landscapes, which play a crucial role in determining the evolution of local
    dynamics within the landscape. I will mention analytical methods to compute
    this statistics and discuss an application to a “signal vs noise” problem
    relevant in the context of high-dimensional statistical inference.

  abstract: |
    Computational and experimental study of atomistic systems is at the heart
    of physics, chemistry and materials science, but necessary measurements are
    often laborious and costly to obtain. We are interested in machine learning
    for prediction and analysis of such data to increase the number of
    accessible systems and enable accelerated study and design of atomistic
    systems at scale and reduced costs. An example is accurate interpolation
    between quantum-mechanical numerical simulations, enabling, for example,
    the screening of large molecular or materials spaces for novel compounds
    with tailored properties. I will provide a brief overview of our
    contributions in this area, emphasizing distinctive traits of this setting
    and the role of domain knowledge, as well as two specific examples of our
    work: The many-body tensor representation, an exact representation of
    finite and periodic atomistic systems, and, rigorous quantitative
    assessment of prediction errors and predictive uncertainties of machine
    learning models for molecules and materials.

  title: "Optimal Quantum Control with Digitized Quantum Annealing"

    institute: "Sissa Trieste"
  abstract: |
    Various optimization problems that arise naturally in science are
    frequently solved by heuristic algorithms. One of the recent quantum-based
    algorithms, potentially promising for the implementation on near-term
    devices, is the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)
    introduced by Farhi et al. (arXiv:1411.4028). I will give an overview of
    the algorithm, discussing its connection with Quantum Annealing and Quantum
    Control. In particular, I will show how a digitized version of QA can be
    made optimal, realizing the best possible solution allowed by quantum
    mechanics in the shortest time, and without spectral information. I will
    illustrate this on a simple benchmark problem, MaxCut on a 2-regular graph,
    equivalent to an unfrustrated antiferromagnetic Ising chain, with the
    standard transverse field used to introduce quantum fluctuations.
