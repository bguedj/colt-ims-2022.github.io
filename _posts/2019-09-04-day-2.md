  abstract: "The ability of deep neural networks to generalize well in the
overparameterized regime has become a subject of significant research
interest. In genomics, autoencoders in particular are emerging as a unique
approach to integrate and translate between different data modalities. We
study overparameterized autoencoders and show that they exhibit a strong
form of self-regularization that constrains the function learned through
the optimization process to concentrate around the training examples,
although the network could in principle represent a much larger function
class. In particular, we prove that fully-connected autoencoders project
data onto the (nonlinear) span of the training examples. In addition, we
show that autoencoders learn a map that is locally contractive at the
training examples, and hence iterating the autoencoder results in
convergence to the training examples. This has important implications for
privacy, provides a new mechanism for memory and recall through gradient
descent in neural networks, and leads to practical guidelines with respect
to the selection of network architecture."
