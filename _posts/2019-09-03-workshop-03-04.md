title:  "DALI: Hidden Gems"
layout: multitrack
abstract: "What ideas are important that aren't discussed enough? As machine learning has become more successful, more researchers are looking at the questions that drive the field. But are there issues that we are missing? Ideas that are not getting the attention they deserve? In this workshop each presenter will give a 20 minute overview of an idea that they believe is not getting enough attention in the wider community. Each presentation will be 20 minutes long and will be followed by long discussion of the idea and where it might be deployed."
