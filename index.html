<p>The idea of DALI is to combine the special qualities of the former Snowbird meetings (intimate atmosphere, very good people, plenty of time to interact) with attractive aspects of larger conferences that rarely take place in Europe. We use a three day format with two days of workshops, and one day of plenary talks in the middle, including a poster session. We pick a location that limits jet lag and/or travel times for many of us who normally travel to meetings in the US. The workshops feature research topics of current interest, and workshop participants are nominated by the workshop organizers. DALI is small and (geographically) biased towards European researchers; and participation is by invitation. </p>

<p>DALI 2015-2018 were right after Easter, this year there are <i>two</i> DALI meetings. We met in George, South Africa in January. The next meeting is in the beginning of September.</p>
